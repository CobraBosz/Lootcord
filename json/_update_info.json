Currently only available to players in the official Lootcord server, but expect this to be released to all servers after we're finished testing it."

Check information for a banner using the `item` command, they are treated the same as items except: **They don't take inventory space** and **they don't show in your inventory, instead they are displayed in the `profile` command.** Right now the only banners available are: `recruit`, `looter`, `killer`, and `hitman` but there's room for more in the future."

Keep in mind `xp_potion`'s are still a thing. Why change this??? To add more incentive to opening lower-tier boxes and discourage spamming."
